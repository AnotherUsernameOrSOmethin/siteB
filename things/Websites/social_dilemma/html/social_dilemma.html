        WHAT IT CAN DO
        <p>Social media may seem like a harmless and fun way to connect with people and share your opinions 
            (as long as it coincides with everyone elses opinion), and although it can do a lot of good, 
            there's a lot of bad going on behind the screens.</p>

        <p>If you know the internet, you know that even though it can be an amazing tool, it can also be a cruel weapon at times. A lot of the times, actually.</p>

        <p>Fake news are rampant on today's internet, and they're getting less and less distinguishable from actual news.</p>

        <p>The algorithms in charge of social media platforms, like Facebook, aren't really programmed with the ability to separate fact from false. 
            This results in the two getting mixed as if they were equal. All the algorithm thinks is "Oh! This article about Covid being fake is 
            sure to get these people's attention!", then it's all downhill from there.</p>

        <p>This is likely to be the reason why some communities like the flat earth society and antivaxxers exist in the first place. 
            Fake news get the best of gullible idiots on the net, then people discover they believe the same things and have similar opinions, 
            thus they group together and form communities that spread even more misinformation.</p>

        <p>Also, as these groups continue sharing and writing articles about things they think is real, the AI continues to spread it to vulnerable 
            loners scouring the internet in an increasingly incomprehensible world. It's like they have a truce or something!</p>

        <p>This is also contributing to massive divides in the community, and by THE community, I basically mean society as we know it. 
            The hate between republicans and democrats in the ol' states are a glaring example.</p>

        <p>The reds and blues have almost rallied together against the opposing party, resulting in rather unnececcary psychological warfare.
            Fake news also worsens this effect, as articles are often warped and distorted in order for a
            certain politician to seem favourable. I'm surprised there hasn't been a new civil war yet due to this friction.
        </p>

        <p>It's a shame the internet is being used to babysit children when their parents can't be bothered, or straight up just don't care.
            So many teens that have grown up on the ol' socials can be exposed to so much, for the lack of a better word, awful shit.
        </p>

        <p>Body pressure is also a problem. Let's say someone posts themselves, and 100 people comment.
            If you have slightly thicker eyebrows, someone will notice. If you have a lisp, you might not hear
            the end of it. Worse can happen if you consider yourself gay, or if you're considered gay by others, but that's something else.
            People have this idea of the ideal way a person should look or be, so when someone doesn't coincide 
            with that idea, they're scrutinized. They become self concious. They start thinking that they 
            need to look perfect to be accepted, and that can spiral into depression.

        HOW IT CAN DO
        <p>If you've ever thought "I love that Google is completely free to use, and I can get exactly the information I need, but how do they keep funding it?", 
            I've got news for you; If a service like Google seems free, chances are you're paying with something else</p>

        <p>Social media apps and corporations earn money by "borrowing" a fuck ton of your information; your search inquiries, age, location, interests, 
            even your friends and family's info probably. </p>

        <p>They then feed it to pretty advanced machine learning algorithms that calculate exactly what'll catch your attention at anytime.</p>

        <p>The end goal is to make you stay on their app for as long as possible, and even the app's layout is designed with this goal in mind. 
            Ever noticed when you see a notification pop up and think "Ehh, I'll just watch this video and be on my way", and 30 minutes later 
            you're still on whatever app you were using? Well,</p> <p>that's how they getcha</p>

        <p>The more time you spend on an app, the more info they can gather, the more ads they can precicely target towards you, 
            the more money they make, and the cycle goes on.</p>

        <p>They don't really see you as a person, they see you as just another user, another cog in the money-making machine, 
            another bit that helps teach an AI what people are into, to then make more money.</p>

        <p>Heck, even smart speakers can be used for this! Of course big corporations like Google
            are willing to secretly record someone's conversations about favorite snacks, only to
            target Cheetos ads towards you a minute later! This has already happened, and is still
            happening by the way.
        </p>

        <p>The people who own and run these machines don't even know what's going on in there, it's all computer-language. 
            These hyper-advanced machine learning algorithms are being fed information from everyone who's ever touched social media, 
            by uber rich corporations, that don't even know details of what's happening inside.</p>

        <p>At this point, we're just asking for a real life terminator movie.</p>

    <div class="itemBox3"> 
        WHAT YOU CAN DO
        <p>To stop social media from taking too much control, here are a couple of things you can do:</p>

            <p>Keep your media tidy. </p>
            <p>Instead of being consumed by notifications, you can unfollow or unsubscribe from accounts you 
                think are unnececcary.</p>

            <p>Set boundaries.</p>
            <p>You should limit the amount of time you spend on platforms, i.e don't touch platforms after 9pm,
                don't touch it before you get out of bed, etc. I should know, because I've always done the opposite...
                and in terms of mental health, I'd say I'm around 5/10.
            </p>

            <p>Know your priorities.</p>
                For example, it's not always a good idea to watch Youtube while doing homework, as I'm doing 
                as of writing this, because you can be too easily distracted. If you have tasks to finish, you
                should prioritize them instead of the videos you were going to watch. They'll still be
                there tomorrow. This is something I've yet to master, but it's obviously not impossible. 
            </p>

            <p>Try leaving your phone at home when going for a walk, or to buy groceries.</p>
            <p>If you're just going out to get some fresh air, or leaving just to buy groceries, you don't really 
                need your phone with you. I mean, it's fine to bring your phone if you use it to pay, or to take a pic
                of a thing at the store to ask your parent or guardian if it's the right thing or not, but you don't
                need to check socials every 15-30 minutes.
            </p>

            <p>Hot take: Use the addictiveness to your advantage?</p>
            <p>If you really want to watch a certain video, you can set it as a short term goal for when you finish
                a task, such as washing the dishes, or cleaning the house. Then, you have a reason to finish the
                task! <em>this probably won't work actually</em>
            </p>

            <p>And that is all I have to say about the social dilemma. Everything from what it does, how it does it,
                and a bit on how you can counter its effects. There are sources under that you can check out if you
                want to learn more.
